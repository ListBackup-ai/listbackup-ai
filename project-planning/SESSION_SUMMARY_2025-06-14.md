# Session Summary - 2025-06-14

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Web App Migration ✅
- Successfully migrated entire web application from `/listbackup-ai-v2` to `/platforms/web`
- Implemented shared code architecture with modules in `/shared` directory
- Fixed all build issues including:
  - Missing Radix UI dependencies
  - TypeScript type errors
  - React 19 RC compatibility issues
  - Import path updates
- Web app now builds successfully with 39 static pages

### 2. Go API OAuth Implementation ✅
Created comprehensive OAuth implementation for the Go API:

#### Files Created:
- `/listbackup-ai-v2/backend/golang/internal/config/oauth.go` - OAuth provider configurations for 9 platforms
- `/listbackup-ai-v2/backend/golang/internal/services/oauth.go` - Complete OAuth service with:
  - State generation and validation
  - Token exchange logic
  - Token refresh functionality
  - User info retrieval
- `/listbackup-ai-v2/backend/golang/internal/services/secrets.go` - AWS Secrets Manager service
- Updated OAuth handlers:
  - `oauth-start` - Generates authorization URLs
  - `oauth-callback` - Handles token exchange and source creation

#### OAuth Platforms Configured:
1. Google (Drive, Sheets, BigQuery)
2. HubSpot (CRM)
3. GoHighLevel (CRM)
4. Dropbox (Storage)
5. Box (Storage)
6. QuickBooks (Accounting)
7. Shopify (E-commerce)
8. Keap (CRM)
9. Stripe (Payments)

### 3. Scripts Created
- `/listbackup-ai-v2/backend/scripts/upload-oauth-secrets.sh` - Upload OAuth credentials to AWS Secrets Manager
- `/listbackup-ai-v2/backend/scripts/create-oauth-tables.sh` - Create DynamoDB oauth-states table

### 4. OAuth Credentials Retrieved
Found and documented OAuth client IDs from V1 implementation:
- Google, HubSpot, GoHighLevel, Dropbox, Box, QuickBooks
- Identified that Shopify, Keap, and Stripe need OAuth apps created

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Token Storage Discussion
Analyzed current implementation (AWS Secrets Manager) vs alternatives:

**Current**: Secrets Manager
- Pros: Encrypted, auditable, automatic rotation
- Cons: Cost ($0.40/secret/month), latency (50-100ms)

**Alternative**: DynamoDB with KMS
- Pros: Lower cost, faster access, better for high-frequency reads
- Cons: Need to implement encryption

**Recommended**: Hybrid approach
- DynamoDB for access tokens (frequently accessed)
- Secrets Manager for refresh tokens and client secrets (rarely accessed)

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy OAuth Infrastructure**
   - Run upload-oauth-secrets.sh script
   - Create oauth-states DynamoDB table
   - Deploy Go Lambda functions

2. **Complete Go API**
   - Test OAuth flows for all platforms
   - Implement remaining handlers
   - Deploy all services

3. **Platform Development Priority** (per user guidance)
   - First: Complete Go API for all handlers
   - Second: Focus on web app
   - Third: iOS and Android development

## Technical Notes

- Go API uses AWS SDK v2 with proper context handling
- OAuth implementation includes state validation for security
- Sources are created with proper accountId association
- Activity logging implemented for OAuth connections
- HTML response in callback handler provides good UX with auto-close

## Session Priority Clarification
User explicitly stated: "we want to get the go API functioning for all handlers, then we want to make the web app the focus, then we can focus on ios, android"

This establishes clear development priorities moving forward.
