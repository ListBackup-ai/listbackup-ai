## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend (v2 - This Repository)
- **React 19** + **TypeScript** + **Next.js 15** (App Router)
- **Shadcn/UI** + **Tailwind CSS** for modern components
- **TanStack Query v5** for API state management
- **Zustand** for global state management
- **React Hook Form** + **Zod** for form validation
- **Framer Motion** for animations

### Backend (Existing - DO NOT MODIFY)
- **AWS Lambda** + **Serverless Framework**
- **DynamoDB** for all data storage
- **Google AI (Gemini 2.0 Flash)** integration
- **JWT Authentication** with AWS Cognito
- **S3** for file storage

## 🎯 Project Mission

**What We're Building:**
A modern, professional frontend that elevates the existing robust backend architecture while providing an exceptional user experience.

**Key Insights:**
- The current v1 frontend is already **enterprise-grade and feature-complete**
- The backend is **production-ready** with sophisticated DynamoDB architecture
- This is **modernization, not a rebuild** - enhance what exists
- **AI should be contextual assistant**, not the primary feature

## 🚨 Critical Guidelines

### ✅ DO THIS:
- **Connect to existing APIs** - all endpoints are documented and working
- **Use DynamoDB-first approach** - existing data architecture is solid
- **Focus on UX modernization** - make it beautiful and performant
- **Implement mobile-first design** - responsive across all devices

### ❌ DON'T DO THIS:
- **Don't modify backend APIs** - they're production-ready and stable
- **Don't rebuild everything** - the v1 architecture is sophisticated
- **Don't use PostgreSQL** - the system is 100% DynamoDB-based
- **Don't make chat the primary feature** - contextual AI assistant only

## 🚀 Getting Started for Claude Code Opus 4

1. **Read the main guide**: [docs/START-HERE-CLAUDE-OPUS-4.md](./docs/START-HERE-CLAUDE-OPUS-4.md)
