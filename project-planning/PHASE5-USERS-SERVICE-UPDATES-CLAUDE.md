# Phase 5: Users Service Updates - CLAUDE.md

## Objective
Migrate and enhance user management services to Go, including user profile management, account associations, team management, and user preferences. This phase builds upon the authentication system to provide comprehensive user management capabilities.

## Implementation Details

### Tasks to Complete:
1. **Migrate User Profile Management** (Priority: HIGH)
   - Create user profile CRUD operations
   - Implement profile validation and sanitization
   - Add profile image upload and management
   - Support for custom profile fields
   - Location: `/backend/golang/cmd/handlers/users/profile/`

2. **Implement Account Association Management** (Priority: HIGH)
   - Create user-account relationship handlers
   - Implement account invitation system
   - Add role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Support for account switching
   - Location: `/backend/golang/cmd/handlers/users/accounts/`

3. **Create Team Management System** (Priority: MEDIUM)
   - Implement team creation and management
   - Add team member invitation workflow
   - Create team role and permission system
   - Support for team-based resource access
   - Location: `/backend/golang/cmd/handlers/users/teams/`

4. **Add User Preferences Management** (Priority: MEDIUM)
   - Create user settings and preferences
   - Implement notification preferences
   - Add timezone and localization settings
   - Support for custom user configurations
   - Location: `/backend/golang/cmd/handlers/users/preferences/`

5. **Implement User Activity Tracking** (Priority: LOW)
   - Create user activity logging system
   - Add login/logout tracking
   - Implement user session management
   - Support for activity analytics
   - Location: `/backend/golang/cmd/handlers/users/activity/`

6. **Create User Search and Directory** (Priority: LOW)
   - Implement user search functionality
   - Add user directory with filtering
   - Create contact management features
   - Support for user discovery
   - Location: `/backend/golang/cmd/handlers/users/directory/`

## Documentation Updates Made
- Created comprehensive user management API documentation
- Added RBAC system documentation and examples
- Documented team management workflows
- Created user preference configuration guides
- Added activity tracking and analytics documentation

## Dependencies
- Authentication service (Phase 4)
- DynamoDB service (Phase 2)
- S3 service for profile images (Phase 2)
- SQS service for notifications (Phase 2)
- Email service for invitations
- Hierarchical account system

## Next Steps
1. Complete all user management handler implementations
2. Test RBAC system thoroughly with various scenarios
3. Implement user invitation and onboarding flows
4. Begin migration of remaining services
5. Coordinate with frontend for user management UI updates

## Priority Level
**HIGH** - User management is core functionality that affects all other services. Proper implementation is essential for system usability and security.

## RBAC System Design
- **Roles**: Admin, Manager, Member, Viewer
- **Permissions**: Read, Write, Delete, Manage
- **Scope**: Account-level, Team-level, Resource-level
- **Inheritance**: Hierarchical account permissions
- **Customization**: Custom roles and permissions per account

## Security Considerations
- Validate all user input and sanitize data
- Implement proper authorization checks for all operations
- Ensure users can only access their authorized accounts
- Add audit logging for sensitive user operations
- Protect against user enumeration attacks
- Implement rate limiting for user operations
- Ensure GDPR compliance for user data handling

## Performance Considerations
- Implement caching for frequently accessed user data
- Use efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Consider pagination for large user lists
- Optimize profile image handling and storage
- Monitor query performance and optimize as needed

## Notes
- Maintain data consistency across hierarchical accounts
- Ensure proper cleanup when users are deleted
- Consider implementing soft delete for user data
- Test thoroughly with large user datasets
- Plan for user data migration from existing system
- Coordinate with legal team for privacy compliance
