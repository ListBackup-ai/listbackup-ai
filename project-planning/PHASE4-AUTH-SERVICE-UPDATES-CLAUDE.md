## Deployment

**Auth Service Deployment with Serverless Compose:**

The auth service is configured in `serverless-compose.yml` and successfully deploys with all dependencies:

```bash
cd /Users/nickkulavic/Projects/listbackup.ai/listbackup-ai-v2/backend/golang/services
serverless deploy --config serverless-compose.yml --stage main --aws-profile listbackup.ai
```

Or use the deployment script:
```bash
./deploy-auth-with-compose.sh main listbackup.ai
```

**Deployment Results:**
- âœ… Infrastructure services: All deployed successfully
- âœ… API Gateway: Deployed with JWT authorizer configured
- âœ… Auth Service: All 7 Lambda functions deployed successfully

**Testing Completed:**
- âœ… Deployed updated auth service
- âœ… Test user registration flow: `POST /auth/register`
- âœ… Test user login flow: `POST /auth/login`
- âœ… Test JWT token validation: `GET /auth/status`
- âœ… Test token refresh: `POST /auth/refresh`
- âœ… Test user logout: `POST /auth/logout`
- âœ… Test profile retrieval: `GET /auth/profile`
- âœ… Test account list: `GET /auth/accounts`
- âœ… Verify integration with API Gateway JWT authorizer

## Critical Requirements
- **DOCUMENTATION**: Update local docs as changes are made
- **BOARD TRACKING**: Move Teamwork tasks through proper columns
- **PROGRESS COMMENTS**: Document all work in Teamwork comments
- **COMPREHENSIVE TESTING**: Validate authentication flows work properly

## Authentication Architecture
The auth service is critical for the entire application since it:
- Handles user registration and login
- Manages JWT token generation and validation
- Integrates with Cognito for user authentication
- Provides authorization context for all other services
- Manages user sessions and security

Any issues with the auth service will block all user-facing functionality, making this a critical phase for system operation.
