#### Task 5.4: Test Users Service Deployment
- **Priority**: High
- **Effort**: S (3-5h)
- **Status**: COMPLETED âœ…
- **Dependencies**: Tasks 5.1-5.3 completion

**Implementation Steps:**

2. âœ… Created comprehensive test script for all endpoints
3. âœ… Tested and verified all user endpoints
4. âœ… Verified integration with auth service
5. âœ… Fixed OPTIONS endpoint handling for CORS

**Test Results:**
- âœ… GET /users/me - Successfully retrieves user profile
- âœ… PUT /users/me - Successfully updates user profile
- âœ… GET /users/me/settings - Successfully retrieves settings
- âœ… PUT /users/me/settings - Successfully updates settings
- âœ… GET /users/me/accounts - Successfully lists user accounts
- âœ… OPTIONS endpoints - Properly handled by API Gateway for CORS
- âœ… All endpoints properly authenticated with JWT tokens

#### Task 5.5: Update Users Service Documentation
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Effort**: S (2-3h)
- **Status**: COMPLETED âœ…
- **Dependencies**: Task 5.4 completion

**Implementation Steps:**
1. âœ… Created comprehensive README.md for users service
2. âœ… Documented all endpoints with request/response examples
3. âœ… Added configuration and environment variable documentation
4. âœ… Documented database schema for user tables
5. âœ… Added security considerations and testing information

**Documentation Created:**
- Complete users service README at `/services/api/users/README.md`
- Covers architecture, endpoints, configuration, schemas, and testing
- Includes implementation notes about user IDs and account relationships
- Documents event publishing and security considerations

## Additional Fixes Applied

### CORS OPTIONS Handling
- **Issue**: OPTIONS requests were returning authentication errors
- **Root Cause**: Explicit OPTIONS endpoints were being handled by Lambda functions that check for authentication
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed explicit OPTIONS endpoints from serverless.yml
  - Let API Gateway handle CORS preflight requests automatically
  - Applied same fix to auth service
- **Result**: OPTIONS requests now return 204 No Content with proper CORS headers

## Documentation Updates Made
- âœ… Created this CLAUDE.md file for Phase 5 tracking
- âœ… Created comprehensive users service README.md with full documentation
- âœ… Created test script for validating all endpoints
- âœ… Created build script for compiling Go handlers
- âœ… Updated Teamwork tasks to reflect completion

## Dependencies
### This phase depends on:
- Phase 4: Auth service deployed and functional âœ…
- Infrastructure services (Cognito, DynamoDB, EventBridge) deployed âœ…
- API Gateway with JWT authorizer configured âœ…

### Tasks that depend on this phase:
- Phase 6: Accounts Service Updates (needs users service for user-account relationships)

## Deployment

**Users Service Deployment:**

The users service is configured in `serverless-compose.yml` and can be deployed individually:

```bash
cd /Users/nickkulavic/Projects/listbackup.ai/listbackup-ai-v2/backend/golang/services
# Build binaries first
./api/users/build.sh
# Deploy the service
serverless deploy --config api/users/serverless.yml --stage main --aws-profile listbackup.ai
```

**Deployment Results:**
- âœ… All 5 Lambda functions deployed successfully
- âœ… Endpoints accessible at https://b554ytt8w9.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/users/*
- âœ… JWT authorization working correctly
- âœ… Cross-stack references resolved properly
- âœ… CORS preflight requests handled by API Gateway

**Testing Completed:**
- âœ… Created test user via auth service
- âœ… Retrieved user profile with current account details
- âœ… Updated user profile successfully
- âœ… Retrieved and updated user settings
- âœ… Listed user accounts with permissions
- âœ… Verified JWT token validation
- âœ… Verified CORS preflight handling

## Critical Requirements
- **DOCUMENTATION**: Update local docs as changes are made âœ…
- **BOARD TRACKING**: Move Teamwork tasks through proper columns âœ…
- **PROGRESS COMMENTS**: Document all work in Teamwork comments âœ…
- **COMPREHENSIVE TESTING**: Validate user management works properly âœ…

## Users Service Architecture
The users service is essential for the application since it:
- Manages user profiles and preferences
- Handles user settings and notifications
- Provides account listing with permissions
- Integrates with auth service for authentication
- Publishes events for user actions

The service properly integrates with all infrastructure services and provides a solid foundation for user management across the platform.
