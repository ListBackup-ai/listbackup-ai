# Phase 5 & Phase 6 Completion Status

## Phase 5: Users Service Updates ✅ COMPLETED

### Summary
All users service endpoints have been successfully updated to handle prefix stripping for client-facing responses while maintaining prefixes in the database for type safety.

### Completed Tasks:
1. **Deploy updated users service handlers** ✅
   - Rebuilt all handlers with proper prefix handling
   - Deployed with --force flag to ensure updates
   
2. **Test GET /users/me endpoint** ✅
   - Verified returns user data without "user:" prefix
   - Response correctly formatted for client consumption
   
3. **Test PUT /users/me endpoint** ✅
   - Successfully updates user data
   - Handles prefix stripping in both request and response
   
4. **Test GET /users/me/settings endpoint** ✅
   - Returns settings without prefixes
   - Properly unmarshals settings from DynamoDB
   
5. **Test PUT /users/me/settings endpoint** ✅
   - Updates settings correctly
   - Maintains proper data structure in database
   
6. **Test GET /users/me/accounts endpoint** ✅
   - Returns list of user's accounts
   - All accountId values stripped of "account:" prefix
   
7. **Verify database contains prefixes** ✅
   - Confirmed all database entries maintain prefixes
   - Type safety preserved at storage layer

## Phase 6: Accounts Service Updates ✅ COMPLETED

### Summary
All accounts service endpoints have been updated and tested. Fixed critical bug in PUT endpoint and verified all functionality.

### Completed Tasks:

1. **Update Accounts Service CloudFormation** ✅
   - Service properly references infrastructure resources
   - Uses CloudFormation imports for DynamoDB tables
   
2. **Update Accounts Handler Dependencies** ✅
   - All handlers use proper JWT extraction pattern
   - Authorization context properly handled
   
3. **Update Accounts Service IAM Roles** ✅
   - IAM permissions correctly configured
   - DynamoDB UpdateItem permissions verified
   
4. **Test All Accounts Service Endpoints** ✅
   - **GET /accounts** - Lists user's accounts (tested)
   - **POST /accounts** - Creates new account (tested)
   - **GET /accounts/{accountId}** - Gets specific account (tested)
   - **PUT /accounts/{accountId}** - Updates account (fixed and tested)
   - **DELETE /accounts/{accountId}** - Deletes account (tested)
   - **POST /accounts/{accountId}/sub-accounts** - Creates sub-account (tested)
   - **GET /accounts/{accountId}/hierarchy** - Gets account hierarchy (tested)
   - **POST /accounts/switch-context** - Switches account context (tested)

5. **Fix PUT Endpoint Bug** ✅
   - Fixed settings marshaling issue at line 116
   - Changed from `settingsItem["settings"]` to `&dynamodb.AttributeValue{M: settingsItem}`
   
6. **Documentation Added** ✅
   - Comprehensive documentation added to Teamwork docs reference
   - Includes all endpoints, testing results, and bug fixes

## Key Achievements:

### Technical Improvements:
1. **Consistent Prefix Handling**: All services now properly strip prefixes for API responses while maintaining them in the database
2. **JWT Authorization**: Proper extraction of userId and accountId from JWT claims across all handlers
3. **Bug Fixes**: Critical PUT endpoint marshaling issue resolved
4. **Clean Deployment**: All services rebuilt and deployed with --force flag

### Testing Coverage:
- All 4 users service endpoints tested
- All 8 accounts service endpoints tested
- JWT authentication verified for all protected endpoints
- Database integrity maintained with prefix pattern

### Documentation:
- Added to Teamwork docs reference tool
- Created comprehensive testing documentation
- Documented all bug fixes and solutions

## Next Steps:
While the technical work is complete, the Teamwork project management system seems to have issues updating task statuses. All work outlined in Phase 5 and Phase 6 has been successfully completed as documented above.
