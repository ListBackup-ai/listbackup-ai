# Phase 3: API Gateway Service Updates - Progress

## Overview
Phase 3 focuses on updating the API Gateway service configuration and ensuring it properly integrates with the infrastructure services deployed in Phase 2.

## Current Status

### Completed Tasks âœ…
1. **Reviewed API Gateway Configuration**
   - Located at: `/services/api-gateway/serverless.yml`
   - Already configured to use infrastructure exports
   - Uses Cognito for JWT authorization
   - Custom domain configured: `{stage}.api.listbackup.ai`

2. **Updated Serverless Compose**
   - Added API Gateway to `serverless-compose.yml`
   - Configured dependency on `cognito-infrastructure`
   - Ensures proper deployment order

3. **Task 3.1: Update API Gateway Domain Configuration**
   - Already implemented in current configuration
   - Stage-based domain naming: `${self:provider.stage}.api.listbackup.ai`
   - Custom domain resources configured
   - Route53 record setup complete

4. **Task 3.3: Create Cross-Stack Reference Outputs**
   - All required exports already in place:
     - HttpApiId
     - HttpApiEndpoint
     - CustomDomainEndpoint
     - CognitoAuthorizerId

5. **Task 3.6: Update Serverless Compose with API Gateway**
   - API Gateway added to compose configuration
   - Dependencies properly configured
   - Task marked as complete in Teamwork

### In Progress ðŸ”„
1. **S3 Infrastructure Deployment**
   - Stack creation in progress (re-deployed after initial failure)
   - Required for API Gateway IAM policies
   - Waiting for CloudFormation outputs

2. **API Gateway Testing**
   - Will test deployment once S3 completes
   - Verify all infrastructure references work

## Key Findings

### API Gateway Already Modernized
The API Gateway configuration is already updated with:
- âœ… HTTP API (not REST API)
- âœ… JWT authorization with Cognito
- âœ… Stage-specific custom domains
- âœ… CloudFormation exports for cross-stack references
- âœ… Proper IAM permissions

### Dependencies Properly Configured
```yaml
# From serverless-compose.yml
api-gateway:
  path: ./api-gateway
  dependsOn:
    - cognito-infrastructure  # Uses Cognito for JWT authorization
```

## CloudFormation Exports

The API Gateway exports the following for use by other services:
- `listbackup-api-gateway-main-HttpApiId`
- `listbackup-api-gateway-main-HttpApiEndpoint`
- `listbackup-api-gateway-main-CustomDomainEndpoint`
- `listbackup-api-gateway-main-CognitoAuthorizerId`

## Phase 3 Summary

### Tasks Analysis
Based on review of the current API Gateway configuration:

1. **Task 3.1: Update API Gateway Domain Configuration** âœ…
   - Already implemented with stage-based domains
   - No additional work needed

2. **Task 3.2: Add Environment-Specific Configurations** âœ…
   - Stage parameter support already in place
   - Environment variables use stage references
   - Can add throttling/quotas as needed (not blocking)

3. **Task 3.3: Create Cross-Stack Reference Outputs** âœ…
   - All necessary exports already configured
   - No additional work needed

4. **Task 3.4: Update SSL Certificate Configuration** âœ…
   - Created and deployed domain infrastructure service
   - SSL certificate for `*.api.listbackup.ai` available
   - Added to serverless-compose.yml

5. **Task 3.5: Test API Gateway Deployment** ðŸ”„
   - Pending S3 infrastructure completion
   - Will test full compose deployment

6. **Task 3.6: Update Serverless Compose with API Gateway** âœ…
   - API Gateway added with proper dependencies
   - Domain infrastructure also added

### Key Achievements
- Identified that most Phase 3 tasks were already complete
- Created missing domain infrastructure service
- Updated serverless-compose.yml with all dependencies
- S3 infrastructure deployment in progress

## Next Steps

1. **Complete S3 Deployment**
   - Currently in CREATE_IN_PROGRESS state
   - BucketPolicy resource being created

2. **Test Full Compose Deployment**
   - Once S3 completes, test full infrastructure deployment
   - Verify all cross-stack references work

3. **Update Teamwork Tasks**
   - Mark completed tasks as done
   - Add comments explaining already-implemented features

4. **Continue to Phase 4**
   - Auth Service updates
   - Will depend on API Gateway outputs

## Important Notes

- Task 3.6 created specifically for compose updates
- Each phase now has a compose review task
- Continuous integration of services into compose ensures deployability
